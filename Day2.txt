** In Java everything has to follow the order:
Intropackage Oriented-->Classes-->Methods-->Variables

** Access modifiers --> public, protected, private, default

**With classes, only two access modifiers are allowed or used namely:
--> public
--> default

N.B. KISS Means keep it simply simple

**What is the major difference between public and default:

Public--> It will be accessible everywhere in the project
Default--> It will be accessible only inside the package where that component has been defined

***In a source file, we can create multiple number of classes, however only one will be allowed to be public.
***Also there can be multiple non-public classes.
***It is also not mandatory that we have public classes in a source file
***The source file name must correspond with the public class file name


***A Java class can be defined as a template or blueprint which describes state/ behaviour of its object.

in other words, class is used to create Objects.
