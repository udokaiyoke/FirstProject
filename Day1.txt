Definitions:
Java is basically a High Level, Platform independent programming language which works on principles of
OBJECT ORIENTATION.

By 'High Level' it means an attempt to make the programming language as close as possible to a normal language
like English.The progression was from Hardware --> Machine Language --> Assembly Language --> High Level Language.

N.B Check up Machine Language and Assembly Language.


By Platform Independence : Means it can be run on multiple platforms (Operating Systems). So if one writes a java code
in a windows OS,the code can be compiled and ran  on a linux OS, Unix OS or MaC OS e.t.c. But it should be kept in mind that
all those OS must have Java installed in them.


By Intropackage Orientation: we mean that in everything we do, we use objects.


Identifiers: are legal names of Java components. Java components can be:
--> Variable,
--> Classes,
--> Methods,
--> Interfaces and constants

Rule for Naming Identifiers:
--> Java 'reserved' keyword cannot be used as an identifier e.g public, static, void, main e.t.c
--> First character of an Identifier should be a alphabetic character (a to z), dollar symbol ($) or
Connection character (_)
(any number  or special character is not permitted)
--> After first character, other characters can be combination of $,_,(a to z),(0 to 9)
--> Special characters are not permitted at any case
