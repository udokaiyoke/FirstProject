String Concatenation

**Is a way of combining multiple strings together.

--> In concatenation, string takes precedence over int or double
-->Also double takes precedence over int.

****In Java and Python programming language, the plus (+) operator is overloaded

-->Which means the plus operator can perform both addition and concatenation
--> if any of the operand is a string, the + operator will perform concatenation
-->Execution starts from the left to right..
--> BODMAS rule is respected
--> but if non is a string, the operator will perform the addition function

--> Whenever string concatenation happens, the data type of the output will always be a string.


-->there are Static and Dynamic programming language.
**While static language shows you error during compiling, dynamic languages will wait till the code is ran.##

e.g of Static language is Java, while that of Dynamic language is Python.



***---> JAVA OPERATORS

-->Operators are divided into:

1 Unary Operators --> <Operators which works on one operand at a time
++--> increment operators** increases by 1,
-- --> decrement operator** decreases by 1,
! --> Not operator**changes true to false or false to true

2 Binary Operators --> which work on 2 operand at a time
+, -, *, /, %, ==, &&(and operator), ||(or operator), <, >, <=, >=

**Equality operation (==) will return a boolean result

3 Ternary Operators
?: --


***Static is used to call a method without needing to creat an object of that method.
