Java String and String Concatenation
**In Java "String" is a class and not a datatype and it can be instantiated like other classes

String s = new String (),

**String Concatenation is basically a way to combine two or more strings into a single string. This is done by using '+'
operator.

String s = "We" + "are" + "learning" + "java" + "."

**String values can be concatenated with any other datatype.

boolean b = true
string s = "this is" + " " + b

**Strings are immutable in Java, meaning that once they are defined, they can't be changed.
